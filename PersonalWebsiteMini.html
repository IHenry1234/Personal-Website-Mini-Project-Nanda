            My name is Isabelle Henry <br> <br>
            I am 24 years old,<br> <br>
            my email address is - isabellehenry97421@gmail.com. <br> <br>
            My current job position is a general labourer at Sterling Marking Products Inc.<br>
            handling, assembling and packaging legal kits within the incorporation department for the U.S.A.<br> <br>
            I have just recently starting programming but I am learning quickly on how to advance my skills and making
            sure to practice alot.<br>
            I have joined several groups on social media for HTML,CSS, and javascript to hopefully see others
            work/projects,<br>
            aswell as several tips and tricks to learn in both frontend html and backend.<br>
            The Nanda program is so great and came to me at the right time in my life <br>
            when I decided that is what I would love to do as a career.</p>

            About Me <br> <br>
            I consider myself a reliable and hard-working individual, I love to be independent, I have a knack for making people laugh, I love my pet cat komoka, and my significant other whom I have been with 5 years. <br>
            I was a caregiver for 5 years, a receptionist, I worked for cleaning companies, did general labour in the winter time (snow removal), I have been trying to find out the best fitting career for myself. <br>
            I have recently graduated high school (OSSD) even though I was 23 at the time but I achieved it and got it done, so proud of myself. <br>
            I dropped out of high school at about 17 when my mother got diagnosed with kidney failure and had to start dialysis ASAP.<br>
            Being the youngest out of 8 siblings I knew I needed to help and I did, sadly she had passed away in 2018, and I was offically on my own. <br>
            I have always wanted to have a career in the tech industry, but I had no idea where to even begin.<br>
            I started looking at agencies in London, and I so happened to come across No Kee Kwe and they were advertising the brand new Nanda program <br>
            It was just the day before registration closed, so I called them asap to see if they still had spots available and they did! <br>
            I got all the registration forms and funding forms filled out just in time to join and i'm so glad I did.
